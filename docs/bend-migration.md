# TypeScript to Bend migration

**Purpose:** Guide subsystem migration and the placement of external engine calls.
**Audience:** Contributors, including coding agents implementing and reviewing migrations.
**Status:** Active migration guidance.
**Authority:** Repository migration guidance reflecting the owner's direction; linked product contracts continue to own observable behavior.
**Expected use:** Read before choosing a migration unit, moving orchestration, or wrapping an external engine.
**Lifecycle:** Update with accepted migration-boundary and toolchain decisions; review when the foreign interface, supported runtime lanes, or acceptance workflow changes.

## Choose a complete subsystem

Use strangler fig to replace a complete subsystem: its algorithm, state, data
structures, result construction and error handling. Supporting helpers and
proofs are intermediate work within that unit. Keep its accepted observable
behavior while connecting the Bend implementation to its real consumers.

For graph expansion, the unit includes traversal, cycles, visited state,
budgets, ordered results and pending dependencies. A language parser is a
separate engine boundary.

## Reuse large external engines through Bend

Use Bend's foreign-effect interface for substantial existing engines such as
tree-sitter and language grammars. Reuse their implementations instead of
rewriting a language parser in Bend as part of migrating application logic.
Bend should orchestrate the migrated subsystem and request external engine
work through that interface. The foreign binding performs engine calls and
data conversion; application traversal, policy and state transitions belong
in Bend.

For source analysis, the intended boundary is:

```text
Bend orchestration -> foreign parser call -> typed syntax facts
                   -> Bend graph traversal and result construction
```

An existing TypeScript caller can remain at the subsystem's outer boundary
during adoption. Its presence does not require keeping the migrated algorithm
or its orchestration in TypeScript. Large application-owned algorithms remain
whole migration units; external calls reuse independently maintained engines.

Before implementing a binding, inspect `bend guide` from the repository's pinned
toolchain. Its foreign effects use `IO` declarations with C or JS implementation
imports. Implement and exercise the lanes required by the accepted target;
one lane's working binding does not establish another lane's support.

## Keep the proof boundary explicit

Put foreign calls in the runtime shell and pass typed results into the pure
core. Keep foreign implementations outside the proof import closure. State
and prove the core's validation and domain behavior over those inputs; a core
proof does not prove tree-sitter or its language grammar correct.

The boundary contract must define returned facts, errors, text and byte
encoding, and resource ownership or lifetime where relevant. Exercise the
actual binding and its failures separately from pure-core proofs. Retain
existing deadlines, file-access restrictions and product error semantics.

## Accept the whole migration unit

Agree the laws with the designated reviewer before proving them; Astra is the
reviewer for the current migration. Select checks through [CHECKS.md](../CHECKS.md)
and the [testing matrix](testing-matrix.md). The
[Bend package guide](../packages/agent-flow-bend/README.md) owns current compiler,
ABI and proof entry points.

Qualify the complete observable result against the previous implementation and
measure the real connected consumer, including external calls and conversion.
For the current migration, measure build and execution every 30 minutes and
require at least parity. Report existing production measurements separately
from measurements of an unadopted candidate.

Complete the unit by connecting the qualified implementation, removing the
superseded production TypeScript and passing the required local checks.
Proof counts, helper benchmarks and prototype results alone do not establish
that a subsystem has migrated.
